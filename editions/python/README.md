# The Python edition

> **This is not yet an edition.** §31.4: *"An edition that has not passed the corpus is not an
> edition. It cannot carry the name, appear in the matrix, or be installed by `skynetd`."* It
> currently passes **3 of 31 corpora**. The runner prints that number on every run and this file
> will keep saying so until it is 31.

§73's last column has carried one entry against §31 since the table was written: *"The second
edition, which is what the corpus is for."* This is the start of it.

## What a Python edition is, and the ceiling it declares

§31.3's matrix gives Python a **guest** ceiling and no kernel:

> GIL and GC. Cannot host an enforcing kernel and should never claim to. Remains the best edition
> for simulator drivers, bench harnesses, research and the SDK.

The three rules that keep the matrix honest apply here in full:

1. **An edition below its ceiling reports advisory enforcement.** This edition is an *observer*. It
   computes the same verdicts as the Rust edition and enforces none of them, and it says so in those
   words on every surface it ever grows.
2. **An edition may not raise its own ceiling.** Guest is a property of the language's runtime — a
   garbage collector cannot promise a clamp inside a 1 ms deadline — not a configuration flag.
3. **A ceiling is not a judgement about the language.** Python's ceiling is about a GC, not about
   Python.

## Running the corpus

```
python editions/python/run_corpus.py
python editions/python/run_corpus.py --verbose      # every failure in full
```

No dependencies beyond the standard library, deliberately: an edition whose conformance run needs a
package index is an edition that cannot be checked on the machine it is being reviewed on.

## What passes today

| Corpus | Cases | |
|---|---|---|
| `vocabulary` | 73 | every closed set in the system |
| `semver` | 61 | version ordering and range satisfaction |
| `roles` | 38 | the canonical role grammar |
| | **172** | of 1,055 |

The other 28 corpora have no handler and their 883 cases are counted as such in every run. They are
not skipped and not hidden: a runner that quietly passed three corpora and printed "OK" would be the
most misleading artifact in this repository.

## Where the values come from

**From `reference/typescript/`, never from `corpus/`.**

This is the whole discipline of §31.4 and it is easy to lose. A corpus exists to catch a divergence
between an edition and the reference; an edition generated *from* the corpus agrees with it by
construction and proves nothing. So every constant here is transcribed from the reference edition's
own source, and the corpus then judges the transcription.

It earned its keep twice on the first day:

* A first pass extracted `reserved_capabilities` as **eight** members from a regex that had run past
  the end of a declaration. The real value is one token, `hri.warning`, and both the Rust and
  TypeScript editions say so. A corpus-generated table would have had eight and been wrong in the
  same direction as the tool that built it.
* The `large-major` semver case failed on the first run, and the divergence was not a typo: **Python
  has arbitrary-precision integers and the specification is IEEE-754.** `int("9007199254740993")` is
  exact, `Number("9007199254740993")` rounds, and this edition ordered two versions the reference
  calls equal — while *serialising* them identically, because canonical form renders both as the
  rounded value. A disagreement about ordering that is invisible in the output is the worst shape a
  divergence can take, and nothing but a byte-for-byte corpus would have found it.

## Layout

```
skynet_os/
  canonical.py     canonical JSON — the rule every other module's output passes through
  vocabulary.py    all 73 closed sets
  roles.py         §5's role grammar
  semver.py        §54.2's version ordering and ranges
  corpus.py        the runner and its dispatch
run_corpus.py      the CLI
```

`canonical.py` is a deliberate third implementation of a rule that already exists in
`crates/skynet-json` and `reference/typescript/canonical.ts`, and the duplication is the point: a
corpus whose expected values were produced by the code that checks them would prove nothing.

## What is next, in dependency order

`predicate`, `digest`, `kinematics`, `watchdog`, then the four that carry the weight — `cycle`
(§7's eight guards), `transport` (§6), `admission` (§8) and `certification` (§15). Everything after
the foundation is mechanical; the foundation is canonical serialisation and a runner that refuses to
lie about what it has not done.
