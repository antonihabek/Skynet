# Build log

**This is where work on Skynet OS is logged.** Not `docs/skynet-build-plan.md` — that is the Hub's
document and its session log is the Hub's history, and it is one of three files mirrored between
this repository and BotMarket. Appending OS history to it would either put OS work into the Hub's
log or break the mirror. See `docs/README.md` for the mirroring rule.

Where a session changes something **in the Hub**, the change is made in both copies and recorded
here as well, so this log stays a complete account of what was done from this repository.

What has been built here, what it is measured by, and what is still zero lines. The specification is
`docs/skynet-os-architecture.md`; section references below are to it.

## 2026-08-29 — the repository split, and the parts that must be right before hardware

§22 sets the build order and gives the reason: *"Transport and the kernel are the parts that must be
right before anything touches hardware, and they are the parts that can be written and tested
without any. The temptation is to start with a driver because it produces visible motion; the result
of starting there is a system whose safety argument is retrofitted."*

So this session built those, plus the mechanism that keeps them honest.

### The repository exists, and that was the deadline

§72.3 says the split has to happen **before the first Rust lands**: moving a design document and a
few contract files is minutes, moving that plus a 40,000-line workspace and a CI matrix is a week.
The C header in the Hub's `bindings/` was already vendor-facing code sitting in a private
repository — the problem in miniature, and trivial to fix while it was still small.

Moved in: the specification (both halves plus the Hub build plan), the RHAL C and C++ headers, and
the TypeScript contracts as `reference/typescript/`.

### `crates/skynet-json` — canonical JSON

The rule the whole corpus comparison rests on, because §31.4 asks for **byte-identical** output and
that is only meaningful if there is exactly one way to write a value down. Sorted keys by UTF-8
bytes, no whitespace, integers without a fraction, everything else as the shortest positional
decimal that round-trips, and **absent is not null** — the distinction between "nobody declared a
safety envelope" and "the envelope is null" is the one the platform exists to preserve.

`no_std + alloc`, no dependencies. 16 tests.

### `crates/skynet-rhal` — the Rust view of the ABI

Not a second definition. §31.2 keeps the C ABI single-source "because two definitions of a struct
layout is a segfault", so every type is `#[repr(C)]` in header order and the offsets are asserted —
from Rust here, and from C in `drivers/mock/mock_robot.c` with `_Static_assert`. The two halves meet
in the middle: if either language's layout moves, one of the two suites fails. 7 tests.

### `crates/skynet-kernel` — the Safety Kernel

`#![no_std]`, and `alloc` is deliberately **not linked**, so "this never allocates" is a compile-time
property rather than a code-review promise (§23.1). It takes no clock — `now_ms` is a parameter
(§35.2) — which is what makes replay and simulation work with no special case.

The eight guards in specified evaluation order, the graduated responses, `resolve_limits` composing
three sources of ceilings **by minimum rather than by precedence**, and guards that cannot run
reporting unavailable with the specific missing input named. 45 tests.

It builds for `thumbv7em-none-eabihf` — one source, two targets, which is the certified tier's
argument made mechanical rather than asserted.

Three guards go slightly beyond the reference, and the reason is recorded rather than buried:

* **`mode_gate`** evaluates when the cycle names a capability, holding a command whose token the
  operator did not grant. The reference's cycle vector has no such field.
* **`proximity`** evaluates when something is measuring separation: stop inside the stop distance,
  scale between the two distances.
* **Frame overflow** is a `stop_cat2`, never a truncation — "there is a command I could not
  evaluate" and "there is a command I did not receive" are the same fact.

With reference-derived vectors, none of the three has its input, so behaviour is bit-identical and
the corpus still holds. They are covered by this edition's own suite instead.

### `crates/skynet-contracts` — L2

`resolve_transport`, `admit_package`, `award_certification`, `evaluate_readiness`, and the role
vocabulary all four lean on. Ported from the reference with the shapes pinned field by field. 84
tests. `no_std + alloc`, so an L2 edition can run at install time on a robot with no operating system
worth the name underneath it.

### `corpus/` — 254 cases, and the thing that makes editions survivable

Generated from the reference oracle by `tools/corpus-gen/generate.ts`, which runs curated inputs
through the TypeScript and freezes the canonical bytes. `expected` is a **string**, not an object,
because the requirement is byte-identical output and the bytes are therefore what the file holds.

Coverage: roles (38), transport (36), cycle verdicts (16), limit resolution (14), admission (21),
certification (13), readiness (12), plus 100 generated from two seeded PRNGs written out in full so
regenerating produces byte-identical files and a diff means a behaviour change rather than a
reshuffle.

`crates/skynet-corpus` holds this edition to it. **All 254 reproduce byte for byte.**

Verified that the corpus actually bites: inverting one branch of `derive_verdict` produced 8
divergences with byte offsets and the exact differing values, and reverting restored all 254.

### `drivers/mock` — the mock robot

A body that answers the RHAL with no hardware behind it, and 24 sim-conformance checks against it,
each naming the SCTS id it stands for. Portable C11, clean under `-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic`, no
dependencies beyond a compiler.

The value is the fault injection: a stalled command stream, a joint reporting NaN, an estop asserted
mid-motion, a bus timeout inside a cycle. Being able to develop the dangerous cases without a robot
in the room is the difference between a driver that has been exercised and one that has merely been
run (§63.2).

Its descriptor declares `"envelope": null` even though the mock knows its joints' design torque
limits, because a design value from a model is not a datasheet safety rating (§63.4). That is the
line a driver author is most likely to cross, so the self-test checks it explicitly.

### CI

Four jobs. `rust` (fmt, clippy at `-D warnings`, tests, the MCU build), `abi` (the mock's
conformance run, the C++ wrapper, and that the C header is still includable from plain C99),
`corpus` (regeneration must be a no-op, then every edition sits the same exam), and `invariants` —
claims this repository makes about itself, checked mechanically: the safety claim rule intact, only a
driver able to run native, the kernel linking no allocator, and no third-party dependency anywhere in
`Cargo.lock`.

## Two divergences found by porting, and what happened to them

Writing the Rust against the TypeScript surfaced two places where a faithful port and a sensible
implementation disagreed. Both were resolved toward the oracle, because the corpus is generated from
it and parity is the governing rule.

1. **`no_rate_limit` carried subjects in my first draft.** The reference emits none — the sentence
   already names the setting, and the `rate_limit` guard's own unavailability notice carries
   `profile.max_delta_per_cycle` as its missing input. Naming it twice would put one fact in two
   places for a reader to reconcile.

2. **`common_blockers` ordering.** I sorted ties by the declaration order of `READINESS_CHECKS`,
   which is arguably the nicer property — a fleet dashboard that reorders itself on a tie is a
   dashboard nobody trusts. The reference uses an insertion-ordered map, so ties break by
   first-encounter order. Changed to match, and the reason is in the code: it is a *different
   answer*, not a nicer spelling of the same one, and a corpus case with two equally common blockers
   would have diverged.

## One thing the specification says that the code does not

**§15 says "29 tests across 8 areas". The reference implementation has 30.** The ids match exactly
between the two; the prose is what is stale. The Rust follows the code, because the code is the
oracle the corpus is generated from, and the count is documented at the definition so the next
reader does not re-derive the discrepancy.

## One property of the reference worth flagging rather than fixing

`ceiling_for` consults the per-channel limits and the base-velocity ceiling, and **not** the
whole-body `joint_velocity_max_rad_s` or `joint_torque_max_nm`. That is correct as far as it goes —
nothing at that layer knows whether a given channel carries radians per second or newton-metres, and
the per-joint rating from the transport plan is where a joint's real ceiling comes from. But it means
a channel with no per-channel entry has no magnitude ceiling at all, and a body whose envelope
declares a whole-body torque limit does not get it applied per joint.

Ported faithfully rather than "fixed", because changing it would break parity with the oracle and the
corpus would catch it as a divergence — which is the mechanism working. It belongs in the
specification as a question about what the whole-body figures are *for*, not in a quiet patch.

## Nothing in the Hub was changed

No file in the BotMarket repository was modified. The Hub's `lib/skynet/os/*.ts` stays exactly where
it is: §23.2 gives it a new role — the reference and differential-test oracle — and that role is
served by it staying put and being vendored here, not moved.

The two observations above are findings *about* Hub files, not edits to them. Both are small enough
to fold into the next Hub session rather than reaching across the boundary for; when they are made,
they are made in both copies of the specification.

## What is still zero lines

`skynetd` and its reconciler, the policy runtime, the SPSC ring and observation assembly, OTA and
A/B slots, the black box, every real driver (LeRobot, `ros2_control`, EtherCAT, CANopen, the
simulators, the vendor SDKs), the on-robot console, the frame graph, calibration, the watchdog chain,
POST and homing, and the safety MCU.

§59.5 puts the realistic figure at several engineer-years before a robot moves under this, and
nothing in this session changes that estimate. What it changes is that transport, the kernel and the
admission contract are now written, tested, and pinned by a corpus — which §22 says is the order that
matters, because those are the parts whose safety argument cannot be retrofitted.

## Next, in the order §22 and §32.4 imply

1. **The LeRobot RHAL driver.** The single fastest path from zero to a real device fleet: every robot
   LeRobot supports becomes a Guest-tier Skynet robot for the cost of one driver (§16, §67).
2. **The MuJoCo simulator driver**, which is what makes the sim half of SCTS runnable end to end
   rather than a set of assertions about a mock.
3. **`skynet descriptor from-urdf`** (§63.4) — the highest-leverage tool in Part VIII, because the
   work is largely already done and sitting in a file the robot already has. Roles suggested, never
   assigned; envelope left null.
4. **The Hub side**: the transport endpoint, the embodiment tables, and `/skynet/os` registry
   readiness — which §32.4 puts first because it needs no new tables and answers a question the
   ecosystem actually has.
5. **`skynetd`**, once there is a driver for it to supervise.
